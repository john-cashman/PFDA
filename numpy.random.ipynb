    "##### What is numpy? \n",
    "NumPy which stands for numerical python is a Python library used for working with arrays. It was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant as an open source project that is freely used. In python arrays are slow to process. Numpy solves this problem through something called locality. This is where arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory. Because of this numpy is up to 50 times faster than regular python.\n",
