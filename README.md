Programming for data analysis

John Cashman - G00398261

In this jupyter notebook I will cover how we can test and learn data analytics through the numpy.random package. I will first explain briefly why it is used. I will then cover the multiple features of numpy.random which include:
Simple random data and Permutations, 5 common distributions used within numpy.random and finally the use of seeds to generate pseudo random numbers.

How to run:

To run this program please have anaconda installed on your device.

Open Jupyter on your machine and open the file numpy.random. On the top of ther screen you will need to click on the Kernel and click retart and run all cells. The program will then run and you will be able to view it.
